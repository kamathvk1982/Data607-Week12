Introduction


[Best Buy](www.bestbuy.com) utilizes Recommender System to increase revenues and improve customer experience. Best Buy has been using its recommendation system for eCommerce since 2015.   

The system works by predicting what a customer is interested in based on their individual browsing and purchase data. Best Buy decided to focus on their online sales, and in 2016â€™s second quarter they reported a 23.7% increase, thanks in part to their recommender system.
